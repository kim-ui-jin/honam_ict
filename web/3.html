        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language and core technology of the web platform, alongside HTML and
            CSS.
            Ninety-nine percent of websites on the World Wide Web use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
            behavior.

            Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also
            utilized
            in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time–compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm,
            supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
            interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the
            Document
            Object Model (DOM).

            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
            graphics
            facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ
            greatly
            in design.</p>
